Goals
The National Parks hold some of the most beautiful land in the country. Has there been growth in visitation fueled by the pandemic? We think so.
The parks are at the forefront of a seemingly booming outdoor recreation industry. We think that higher visitation creates more economic benefit, but will the data back it up? 
How does the season affect the amount of people you might encounter on your visit? When would be the best time to plan a visit? 
What is the best national park to visit based upon where you live? If a park is not an option, are there other cool places to visit?
Why do people go to national parks? Let's find out!

Background

The National Park Service has a simple mission. "The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world" (NPS 2023). These are special places to many Americans, and are the best avenues for many to experience the beauty of the natural world. To effectively accomodate the demands of visitation, necessary staffing and infrastructure has to be in place. The best way to know what to plan for is to look at what has happened in the past. “The 2022 visitation report confirms what we have long known to be true—Great Smoky Mountains National Park continues to be a special place for millions of visitors,” said Superintendent Cassius Cash. “We are thinking about what average visitation over the last ten years means for the next ten years and how we will preserve a high-quality visitor experience as well as park resources” (NPS 2023). What can we learn from the past trends in visitation and usage to help the park service effectively plan for the future of the park and the communities that host them. Bringing millions of people each year, how much of an impact does that make on the local economies? 

This project analyses data from the national park service to analyse trends in visitation across the years to investigate these questions further.
