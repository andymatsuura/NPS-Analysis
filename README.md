# Goals 

* The National Parks hold some of the most beautiful land in the country. Has there been growth in visitation fueled by the pandemic? We think so.
* How much money do the national parks bring in? We think that higher visitation creates more economic benefit, but will the data back it up? 
* How does the season affect the amount of people you might encounter on your visit? When would be the best time to plan a visit? 
* What is the best national park to visit based upon where you live? If a park is not an option, are there other cool places to visit?

# Background

The National Park Service has a simple mission. "The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world" (NPS 2023). These are special places to many Americans, and are the best avenues for many to experience the beauty of the natural world. To effectively accomodate the demands of visitation, necessary staffing and infrastructure has to be in place. The best way to know what to plan for is to look at what has happened in the past. “The 2022 visitation report confirms what we have long known to be true—Great Smoky Mountains National Park continues to be a special place for millions of visitors,” said Superintendent Cassius Cash. “We are thinking about what average visitation over the last ten years means for the next ten years and how we will preserve a high-quality visitor experience as well as park resources” (NPS 2023). What can we learn from the past trends in visitation and usage to help the park service effectively plan for the future of the park and the communities that host them. Bringing millions of people each year, how much of an impact does that make on the local economies?

# Analysis
* The National Parks hold some of the most beautiful land in the country. Has there been growth in visitation fueled by the pandemic? We think so.
* There was a significant decrease in visitation in 2020, as a result of the lockdowns, but in 2021 parks received record visitation. This has put a strain on the park system and the communities they are in. 870,000 new visitors come to the parks every year, and the rate of increase is getting higher. "Interviews with park supervisors, staff and guests paint a picture of a system under increasing strain and struggling to adapt to this new reality" (The Guardian 2021). People were more willing to travel and were possibly tired of being stuck inside all of the time. So initially, covid had a negative impact on park visitors, but when lockdowns started to ease people were eager to get out there. We noticed a sharp increase in visitation since 2015. It's possible that being able to share your experiences through social media so easily made the appeal to be in beautiful places increased.

* Gaining on average 870,000 new visitors every year, the parks service will have to adapt going forward.

* In 2017, Trump instated a federal hiring freeze, thus parks were not able to hire new employees (Vice). We noticed the downwards trend in jobs that year. Less employees combined with higher visitation created stress on the park system (On Labor). Housing is unaffordable for park employees, further exacerbating staffing issues.

* How much money do the national parks bring in? We think that higher visitation creates more economic benefit, but will the data back it up? 
* In 2022, the NPS contributed 50.3 billion dollars to the economy through visitor spending, donors and corporate partners. The park service cited that 1 dollar invested in the NPS provides a $10 boost to the economy (jec.senate). Every year, there is growth of approximately 700 million dollars. This data could be skewed because of the covid dip in 2020 (nationalparks.org).

* How does the season affect the amount of people you might encounter on your visit? When would be the best time to plan a visit? 
* It was hard to find data by the season for the entire national parks, but summer is the most popular time to visit Yosemite. This is a park that is familiar to us in California. There are less visitors in the winter, so it could be a good time to visit, though you will encounter snow and possible bad weather. The spring and fall are your best bet for less crowds and mild conditions.

* What is the best national park to visit based upon where you live? If a park is not an option, are there other cool places to visit?
* Hawaii and Alaska seem like outliers for visitation, with their geographic isolation. The intermountain and pacific west regions seemed to be the most popular, and many parks seemed skewed towards the west side of the country. There were fewer parks on the east coast, but it held the most popular park in the country, Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The hvplot used dots based on volume of visitation.

* Great Smoky Mountain National Park had extreme growth since inception. We found that there was a dip in 1989 in Acadia and Great Smokys, possibly due to changes in counting methods (MDIslander). Covid dip was apparent in 2020 in these popular parks, but Great Smokys experienced a sharp increase!

# Conclusion

* The National Parks hold some of the most beautiful land in the country. Has there been growth in visitation fueled by the pandemic? We think so.
* In 2020, during the initial lockdowns, there was much lower visitation compared to previous years. However, in 2021, parks broke visitation records. So it had a differing impact than our initial hypothesis.
* How much money do the national parks bring in? We think that higher visitation creates more economic benefit, but will the data back it up?
* In 2022, the national parks contributed 50.3 billion dollars to the economy. Recent growth has been predicted to be around 700 million dollars per year. This is quite significant and its growth in economic output is shown to increase with contributions to local jobs and visitor spending.
* How does the season affect the amount of people you might encounter on your visit? When would be the best time to plan a visit?
* The summer is the most popular time to visit, but it might not be the best due to crowds. The winter is the least busy time of year but there is a greater chance of encountering bad weather. The spring and fall seem to have the best mix of less crowds and potentially good weather, but further analysis would be required.
* What is the best national park to visit based upon where you live? If a park is not an option, are there other cool places to visit?
* There are less parks in Hawaii and Alaska, and thus visitation would be lower because of the geographic isolation. There seem to be more parks on the west coast and the central part of the country, and less parks (and thus less visitors) to the east coast. Great Smokey Mountain National Park is the most popular national park and would be a fun place for all to experience!
